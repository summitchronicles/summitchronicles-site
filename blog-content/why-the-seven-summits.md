# Why the Seven Summits? A Journey of Purpose, Passion, and Perseverance

*Posted: March 15, 2024 | 5 min read*

## The Question Everyone Asks

"Why climb the Seven Summits? Why risk everything for some mountains?"

I've been asked this question hundreds of times. The answer isn't what most people expect.

## It Started with a Failure

Three years ago, I stood at 14,000 feet on Mount Whitney, gasping for air, watching my climbing partner disappear into the clouds above. I couldn't go another step. My body had given up.

That night, shivering in my tent, I realized something: **I had been treating life like a spectator sport.**

## The Real "Why"

The Seven Summits aren't about conquering mountains. They're about conquering the voice in your head that says "you can't."

Every morning at 4:30 AM when my alarm goes off for training, that voice whispers: *"Stay in bed. You're not cut out for this. Who do you think you are?"*

**The mountains are just the classroom. The real lesson is learning to show up anyway.**

## What This Journey Teaches

### 1. Systematic Preparation Beats Natural Talent
I'm not a natural athlete. I'm an engineer who discovered that the same methodical thinking that builds software can build the body and mind for extreme challenges.

### 2. Community Makes the Impossible Possible
Every step toward Everest is funded by people who believe in this journey. Their support isn't just financial â€“ it's emotional fuel when the training gets brutal.

### 3. Failure Is Information, Not Identity
That day on Whitney? It taught me more about my limits than any success ever could. Now I train at those limits daily.

## The Real Summit

The Seven Summits will end someday. But the person this journey is creating? That transformation is permanent.

**That's why I climb.**
