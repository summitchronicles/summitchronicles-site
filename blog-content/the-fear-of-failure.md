# The Fear That Keeps Me Going

*Posted: March 29, 2024 | 3 min read*

## Everyone Asks About Success. I Think About Failure.

"What if you don't make it to the summit?"

Most people ask this to be supportive, expecting me to deflect with confidence. Instead, I lean in.

**I think about failing every single day.**

## The Statistics Don't Lie

- Everest success rate: ~60%
- Serious injury rate: ~4%
- Fatalities: 1.2% of attempts

These aren't abstract numbers. They represent real people with real dreams who didn't come home the same way they left.

## My Specific Fears

### Physical Failure
What if my body gives out at 25,000 feet? What if the training isn't enough?

### Financial Failure  
What if I can't raise the funds and have to compromise on safety equipment or experienced guides?

### Judgment Failure
What if I make the wrong decision in the "death zone" and it costs everything?

### Community Failure
What if I let down everyone who believed in this journey?

## Why Fear Is My Friend

Here's the paradox: **This fear is exactly why I might succeed.**

Fear keeps me:
- **Obsessive about preparation**: Every detail matters when failure means death
- **Humble about the challenge**: Overconfidence kills on mountains
- **Grateful for support**: Knowing I can't do this alone
- **Present in training**: Every workout is preparation for survival

## The Real Conversation

When people ask "What if you don't make it?" I tell them the truth:

**The attempt matters more than the summit.**

If I turn back at 28,000 feet because conditions are unsafe? That's success.
If I summit but compromise my values to get there? That's failure.

## What Failure Would Teach

Even worst-case scenarios have value:
- Physical limits teach humility
- Financial constraints teach resourcefulness  
- Poor decisions teach wisdom
- Community disappointment teaches responsibility

## The Fear-Fueled Training

Yesterday's workout was powered entirely by fear. Not fear of the mountain â€“ fear of being unprepared for it.

**That fear drove me through the hardest training session yet.**

## The Real Mountain

Mount Everest is just rock and ice. The real mountain is the fear that whispers "you're not enough."

Every day I choose to train anyway is a day I summit that mountain.

**And that summit matters more than any peak in the Himalayas.**
