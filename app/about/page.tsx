      <h1>About Summit Chronicles</h1>
      <p>I am Sunith Kumar, a survivor turned mountaineer. My journey began with battling tuberculosis and surgeries, and it evolved into a mission to climb the Seven Summits while raising awareness for mental health and TB.</p>
      <p>So far, I have completed Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, Elbrus, and Denali. Everest 2027 is my next big goal.</p>
      <p>Summit Chronicles is my way of sharing this story, inspiring others, and building a community around resilience, adventure, and advocacy.</p>
