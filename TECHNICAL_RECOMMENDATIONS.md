## üöÄ Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. CMS Strategy
**Recommendation:** Enhance existing Sanity CMS setup

**Rationale:**
- Already integrated and functional
- Supports structured content needed for personalization
- Good performance characteristics
- Editor-friendly interface

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Enhanced Sanity schemas
export const personalBackground = {
  name: 'personalBackground',
  title: 'Personal Background',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'professionalSummary',
      title: 'Professional Summary',
      type: 'text',
      description: 'Brief overview of professional background'
    },
    {
      name: 'climbingOriginStory',
      title: 'Climbing Origin Story',
      type: 'blockContent',
      description: 'How and why climbing journey began'
    },
    {
      name: 'coreValues',
      title: 'Core Values',
      type: 'array',
      of: [{type: 'string'}]
    }
    // Additional fields...
  ]
}
```

### 2. Performance Considerations
**Current Status:** Excellent (Phase 3 optimizations implemented)

**Additional Optimizations:**
- Lazy loading for testimonial components
- Image optimization for personal photos
- CDN caching for audience-specific content
- Server-side rendering for SEO benefits

### 3. SEO Strategy
**Current Foundation:** Good structured data implementation

**Enhancements Needed:**
```typescript
// Enhanced structured data
interface PersonalBrandStructuredData {
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Sunith Kumar",
  "jobTitle": "Software Engineer & Mountaineer",
  "description": "Software engineer climbing the Seven Summits...",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://linkedin.com/in/sunithkumar",
    "https://strava.com/athletes/sunith"
  ],
  "hasOccupation": {
    "@type": "Occupation",
    "name": "Software Engineer"
  },
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Mountaineering",
    "High-altitude training",
    "Software engineering",
    "Seven Summits"
