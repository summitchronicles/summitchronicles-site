# Summit Chronicles Deployment Log

## Date: September 13, 2025
## Total Time Spent: ~8 hours
## Status: FAILED - No working deployment after full day

---

## Summary of Attempts

### PHASE 1: Initial Vercel Issues (Morning)
**Problem**: Build failures with API route execution during static generation
- Error: "supabaseUrl is required" during build process
- Root cause: API routes executing during Next.js build time
- Multiple deployment attempts failed with timeouts

### PHASE 2: Migration to Netlify (Afternoon)
**Decision**: Abandon Vercel, migrate to Netlify
**Actions Taken**:
1. **Removed all Vercel configurations**:
   - Deleted `vercel.json`, `.vercelignore` 
   - Uninstalled Vercel CLI from package.json
   - Removed `.vercel` directory

2. **Created Netlify Configuration**:
   ```toml
   # netlify.toml
   [build]
     command = "npm run build"
     publish = ".next"

   [[plugins]]
     package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

   [build.environment]
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "https://nvoljnojiondyjhxwkqq.supabase.co"
     # ... other env vars
   ```

3. **Updated package.json**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "netlify deploy --prod",
     "ai-devops": "node ai-devops-netlify.js"
   }
   ```

4. **Created AI DevOps Pipeline for Netlify**:
   - 6-stage automated deployment pipeline
   - Playwright browser automation for testing
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Performance monitoring

### PHASE 3: API Route Fixes
**Problem**: Same "supabaseUrl is required" errors on Netlify
**Solution**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all API routes

**Fixed Files**:
- `/app/api/rss/route.ts` ✅
- `/app/api/blog/tags/route.ts` ✅  
- `/app/api/strava/activities/route.ts` ✅
- `/app/api/strava/fix-schema/route.ts` ✅
- `/app/api/strava/setup/route.ts` ✅
- `/app/api/blog/media/upload/route.ts` ✅
- `/app/api/blog/media/setup-storage/route.ts` ✅

### PHASE 4: Netlify Deployment Attempts
**Results**: 
- ✅ Local builds successful (66 static pages generated)
- ❌ Netlify deployments consistently failed
- Created fresh site: `14c835b5-d5fe-44f4-a690-0165f4c40608`
- Multiple deployment timeouts
- Sites responding with 404s despite successful builds

### PHASE 5: Return to Vercel (Evening)
**Decision**: Complete fresh start with Vercel
**Actions Taken**:
1. **Deleted all Netlify configurations**:
   - Removed both Netlify sites completely
   - Deleted `netlify.toml`, `.netlify` directory

2. **Fresh Vercel Setup**:
   - Deleted existing Vercel project completely
   - Created new project: `summit-chronicles-starter`
   - Added environment variables via CLI

3. **Environment Variables Added**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://nvoljnojiondyjhxwkqq.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   SUPABASE_URL=https://nvoljnojiondyjhxwkqq.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

### PHASE 6: Final Vercel Results
**Current Status**: 
- Site URL: `https://summit-chronicles-starter-lxxjdczrv-summit-chronicles-projects.vercel.app`
- Status: **DEPLOYMENT FAILED** 
- Response: "Deployment has failed" error page
- Build Status: ERROR (2 minutes duration)

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. API Route Build-Time Execution
- **Problem**: Next.js tries to execute API routes during static generation
- **Attempted Fix**: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` 
- **Result**: Still failing on both platforms

### 2. Environment Variables
- **Problem**: Missing Supabase configuration during build
- **Attempted Fix**: Added all required env vars to both platforms
- **Result**: Still failing

### 3. Complex Dependencies
- **Dependencies causing issues**:
  - `@supabase/supabase-js`
  - `@sentry/nextjs` 
  - `@opentelemetry/instrumentation`
  - Multiple AI/ML libraries

### 4. Build Process
- **Local builds**: ✅ Always successful (66 pages)
- **Platform builds**: ❌ Always fail despite same codebase
- **Warnings**: OpenTelemetry, Redis config warnings (non-critical)

---

## Files Modified During Process

### Created Files:
- `netlify.toml` (later deleted)
- `ai-devops-netlify.js` - 6-stage deployment pipeline
- `monitor-deployment.js` - Site monitoring script
- `add-vercel-env.sh` - Environment variable setup script
- Various test/monitoring scripts

### Modified Files:
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and removed Vercel CLI
- All API route files - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` exports
- `.gitignore` - Added deployment artifacts

### Deleted Files:
- `vercel.json` 
- `.vercelignore`
- `.netlify/` directory
- `.vercel/` directory

## Deployment URLs Attempted

### Netlify:
- `https://summit-chronicles-fresh.netlify.app/` ❌
- `https://14c835b5-d5fe-44f4-a690-0165f4c40608.netlify.app/` ❌

### Vercel:
- `https://summit-chronicles-starter-b0xln9avn-summit-chronicles-projects.vercel.app` ❌ 
- `https://summit-chronicles-starter-lxxjdczrv-summit-chronicles-projects.vercel.app` ❌

---

## Current Codebase State

### Working Locally:
- ✅ `npm run dev` - Development server works
- ✅ `npm run build` - Build completes successfully  
- ✅ All 66 static pages generate
- ✅ No API route execution errors locally

### Failing on Platforms:
- ❌ Both Netlify and Vercel deployments fail
- ❌ Same underlying issues on both platforms
- ❌ Complex dependency conflicts

---

## Next Steps (Option 1: Strip Down)

### Backup Current State:
- All API routes fixed with `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` ✅
- Environment variables documented ✅
- Deployment configurations saved ✅

### Minimal Deployment Plan:
1. **Remove all API routes temporarily**
2. **Create minimal Next.js app with just static pages**
3. **Deploy minimal version to confirm platform works**  
4. **Add features back incrementally**

### Files to Temporarily Remove/Disable:
- `/app/api/` directory (move to `/app/api-disabled/`)
- Complex dependencies (Supabase, Sentry, AI libraries)
- Environment variables (keep only essential ones)
- Service worker and advanced features

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Both Netlify and Vercel struggle with complex Next.js 14.2.13 apps**
2. **API route build-time execution is a persistent issue**
3. **Local builds don't guarantee platform builds will work**
4. **Environment variables alone don't solve the core issues**
5. **Complex dependencies create deployment conflicts**

---

## Time Investment
- **Research & Setup**: 2 hours
- **Netlify Migration**: 3 hours  
- **API Route Fixes**: 1 hour
- **Vercel Return & Debugging**: 2 hours
- **Total**: ~8 hours with zero working deployments

This represents a significant productivity loss and highlights the complexity of modern Next.js deployment on serverless platforms.
