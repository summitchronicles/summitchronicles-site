// ✅ Task 4: Altitude Training
// ==========================

export const altitudeTraining = {

  howIPrepare: `
I live and train in Hyderabad, India—a city that sits at about 568 meters and is mostly flat. While I don’t have access to high-altitude terrain, I simulate elevation with nearby boulder trails (~50 meters), gym-based incline treadmill hikes, stair climbing in high-rise buildings, and road running. My training starts at 7 hours per week and gradually builds up to 18 hours as the expedition nears. Elevation-focused sessions follow the same curve, starting at around 1 hour and building up to 6–7 hours a week.

I use several strategies to simulate altitude and increase endurance under load. This includes walking on a treadmill with a 12–15% incline (often with a weighted pack), climbing over 200 floors per session, dragging a sled or tire outdoors, and wearing an altitude mask during indoor workouts. My weighted backpack starts at 8 kg and progressively goes up to 28 kg. I also include trail running on the boulders, indoor rock climbing, and cycling as part of the routine.

Training is structured over months, with clear phases for build-up, peak, and taper. I closely monitor how I feel and adjust volume accordingly. Two to three weeks before the climb, I taper by reducing volume by about 40–60% to allow recovery. Supplement-wise, I take creatine, multivitamins, fish oil, electrolytes, and ZMN. I also use compression sleeves for post-training recovery. Recovery data is pulled from my Garmin—HRV, pulse ox, sleep score, fatigue ratio, and readiness metrics all help guide my day-to-day decisions.

  symptomsToWatch: `
Over the years, I’ve learned to recognize early symptoms of altitude sickness through personal experience. The first signs I usually notice include headache, nausea, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, body aches, labored breathing, and feeling cold even when wearing multiple layers. These symptoms are my body’s way of signaling that acclimatization isn’t going well.

I’ve had AMS twice. The first time was during my summit push on Stok Kangri (21,000 ft), where I experienced dizziness, intense nausea, and a splitting headache. The second was unexpectedly on Sandakphu (12,000 ft), where I got a fever, severe body aches, and chills—proof that AMS can hit at lower altitudes too. These episodes taught me that there’s no room for ego at altitude.

When symptoms appear, I respond based on the stage and severity:
- If under 13,000 feet, I usually take Diamox and observe for 24 hours. If symptoms persist, I descend.  
- Above 15,000 feet, it's safer to descend immediately or rest until improvement.  
- Regardless of altitude, hydration is non-negotiable. I increase water and electrolytes intake aggressively.  
Listening to your body and acting early is the key. It’s always better to lose a day than lose your summit—or worse.

  experienceAndTips: `
Altitude is a great equalizer. Over the years, I’ve developed a few non-negotiables that help me adapt better. The basics matter: climb high, sleep low. Keep hydrating—always. Layer your clothes properly to regulate body temperature. And above all: do not rush. The mountain will wait. You have to earn your breath, one step at a time.

I’ve made my share of mistakes. In the early days, I underestimated preparation—both physical and mental. I didn’t fuel my body well, skipped proper acclimatization, and often pushed too far because I thought I had to “tough it out.” That mindset doesn’t work at altitude. It humbles you fast.

Today, I train specifically for the mountain I'm attempting—not with a generic plan. I spend time researching the terrain, understanding the weather patterns, and refining my gear loadout based on the environment. These small shifts have made all the difference—not just in reaching the summit, but in returning stronger, smarter, and safer.

// ✅ Task 5: Gear
// ==========================

export const mountaineeringGear = {

  essentials: `
My expedition packing always starts with the core essentials. For footwear, I carry everything from double or triple boots for extreme cold, to trail runners and road shoes for basecamp movement. Camp booties and slip-ons are must-haves for recovery. I carry multiple sock types: normal, hiking, running, thick mountaineering socks, and summit-day options.

In layering, I’ve dialed in my system: base layers (top and bottom), mid-layers, multiple insulation layers, softshell, hardshell, down jackets, pants, a down suit, and a rain jacket. For sleep, I pack a sleeping bag (−5°C, −18°C, or −30°C depending on the climb), a pillow, an insulated mat, and a backup mattress. Additional must-haves include a headlamp, trekking poles, mittens and gloves of varying thickness, ice axes, crampons, a climbing harness, figure 8, carabiners, jumar, quickdraws, and ropes.
  `,

  lessonsLearned: `
I’ve learned a lot the hard way. Poor layering choices (like under-insulated jackets), gear failures (broken crampons, torn boots, dead headlamps), and missing essentials (chapstick, SPF, foot powder, or proper hats) can ruin a climb. Backpack volume matters—don't carry too little or too much. Gear isn't just about function—it's about foresight.
  `,

  brandsILike: `
Today, I only rely on trusted brands:
- Boots: Salewa, La Sportiva, Solomon, Scarpa
- Base Layers: Smartwool, Quechua
- Shells & Insulation: Arc’teryx, RAB, North Face
- Gloves & Mittens: RAB, North Face
- Sleeping Systems: RAB, North Face
- Backpack: Osprey
- Headlamp & Poles: REI
- Crampons: Petzl, Black Diamond

Every piece of gear must earn its place in my pack—and its weight.

// ✅ Task 6: Mental Preparation
// ==========================

export const mentalGame = {

  handlingFear: `
Fear is a construct—or at least, that’s what I try to tell myself. But the truth is, we’re all scared. I still am. The first time I laid eyes on the big Himalayan peaks, I was terrified. I’ve had a fear of heights my entire life, and it still hits me hard.

Whenever I’m in high-exposure zones—where I have to look down and see a steep drop—the fear comes back in waves. I’ve had panic attacks. I’ve sweated through layers. I’ve felt like I was suffocating. And yet... I keep coming back. I continue to put myself in these situations because they make me feel alive. They force me to live one breath at a time. They remind me what it means to push boundaries—mine.

When fear shows up, I turn to long, conscious breaths—sometimes using box breathing to bring my heart rate back down. I remind myself of why I’m here: to climb all Seven Summits, to honor the battles I’ve survived—including tuberculosis—and to carry forward the memory of the friends I’ve lost who died chasing their passion. Fear doesn’t go away. But it becomes fuel.
  `,

  mentalTechniques: `
I rely heavily on visualization. I’m a visual learner and doer. Before any climb, I spend time mentally mapping out the route—how I’ll move, what decisions I’ll make, where the danger zones are. I visualize the summit push, the fatigue, the cold, the triumph. I even run mental math on how many steps I’ll need or how much time to checkpoint X.

Cold exposure is part of my toolkit. I use it to build discomfort tolerance and train my nervous system to stay calm when conditions are brutal. Because I have ADHD, structure is essential—so everything becomes a checklist. Waking up on a mountain starts with warm water, then cold, followed by two rounds of box breathing. Only after I calm my nerves do I unzip the tent.

During long slogs or low-motivation days, I remind myself why I’m doing this—but I also stay practically engaged. I use music and podcasts to stay stimulated. I pull inspiration from my own story, from others chasing the same madness, and from the memory of people who never made it home. And sometimes, I let myself cry. Because climbing mountains isn’t just a physical journey—it’s emotional, too. And there’s no shame in feeling everything fully.
  `,

  tbToMountainsMindset: `
Surviving tuberculosis shaped how I view pain, discomfort, and challenge. Nothing I’ve faced on a mountain—no cold, altitude, or exhaustion—has ever compared to those years I spent in and out of hospitals. Maybe it’s an exaggeration. Or maybe that’s just how trauma lives in memory. But I know this: every setback now feels like a restart, not a dead end.

I don’t see myself as inspirational. I’m just extremely stubborn. My ADHD gives me tunnel vision when it comes to goals—I set them aggressively, and I chase them relentlessly. I’m also brutally hard on myself, always demanding more. Every climb is a way to prove that I’m better than yesterday, not to the world, but to me. TB didn’t just scar my lungs—it wired my brain to push further, to feel deeper, and to never take a breath for granted.

// ==========================
// ✅ Task 7: Physical Training
// ==========================

export const physicalTraining = {

  weeklyRoutine: `
My training is periodized based on the expedition timeline. In the base phase, I start with around 6–7 hours per week. As the climb gets closer, I build up to 16–18 hours per week during the peak phase. I track all metrics using Garmin to monitor volume, fatigue, and training readiness.

A typical training week is a mix of cardio (running, stair climbing, cycling), strength sessions (lower body, anterior/posterior split), and long hikes or tire dragging sessions to simulate mountain load. I also include a dedicated mobility and core stability session once a week. Active recovery or a full rest day is non-negotiable and built into the schedule—usually once a week depending on fatigue data.
  `,

  tbToAthlete: `
When I finished TB treatment, I was a bag of bones. I weighed 48 kg, couldn’t walk 50 meters without losing breath, and had zero functional strength. My mindset was shattered—I didn’t recognize myself. My first instinct was to build muscle, so I hit the gym. I believed that more muscle equaled better survival. I was wrong. What I needed was endurance, resilience, and a different kind of strength.

It took me nearly two years—and a lot of trial and error—to shift from broken body to baseline athlete. I had to relearn movement, rebuild trust in my body, and understand that survival isn’t about mass—it’s about adaptation. One of my biggest physical milestones was reaching Goechala in Sikkim, a 16,500-foot trek that tested everything I had built. Emotionally, standing at Everest Base Camp for the first time was the moment I felt like I had returned. Not just physically, but as a person.
  `,

  ultraMarathon: `
Ultra marathon training pushed my boundaries in ways no gym session ever could. For races like the Tata Ultra, I was running close to 100 km a week—sometimes on trails, sometimes on pavement, sometimes just on tired legs. It wasn’t glamorous. But it taught me one thing: you just need to shut up and move.

That’s the core of endurance—learning how to keep going when everything in you wants to stop. That mental wiring directly translates to high-altitude climbs. When you’re above 6,000 meters and every breath burns, it’s the same principle: just move forward. Don’t overthink. Don’t negotiate with the mountain. Just move.

Training for ultras made me metabolically efficient, mentally tougher, and less afraid of long-duration discomfort. It gave me a different kind of summit prep—one that lives in your feet, your lungs, and your mind.
