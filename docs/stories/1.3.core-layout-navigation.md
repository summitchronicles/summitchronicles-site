## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 established the complete Swiss spa design system with atomic components (Button, Typography, Card, Input, Icon, etc.). This story builds upon those components to create full layout organisms and templates.

### Design System Components Available
[Source: Story 1.2 implementation]
- **Atoms**: Button (4 variants), Typography (Display, H1-H4, Body, Serif), Input/Textarea, Icon, comprehensive Swiss spa styling
- **Molecules**: Card (3 variants), FormField, StatusBadge with semantic colors
- **Utilities**: cn() function for className merging, full Tailwind Swiss spa configuration

### Swiss Spa Navigation Principles
[Source: bmad-method/docs/architecture.md#swiss-spa-design-system-foundation]
- **Premium Positioning**: Navigation should feel luxurious and sophisticated, differentiating from typical adventure portfolios
- **Generous White Space**: 8px grid system with spacious layouts that feel premium
- **Subtle Interactions**: Smooth 300-400ms transitions, elegant hover states without flashy effects
- **Clean Typography**: Helvetica Neue for navigation, clear hierarchy, readable at all sizes

### Layout Architecture Requirements
[Source: bmad-method/docs/architecture.md#atomic-design-component-architecture]
- **Organisms**: Header, Footer, SidebarNavigation with consistent Swiss spa styling
- **Templates**: DefaultLayout, DashboardLayout, BlogLayout with optimal reading experiences
- **Component Structure**: `/app/components/organisms/` and `/app/components/templates/` organization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with elegant tablet and desktop experiences

### Navigation Structure Requirements
[Source: bmad-method/docs/prd.md functional requirements]
- **Primary Navigation**: Home, About, Blog, Training, My Story key sections
- **Secondary Navigation**: Media Kit, Speaking, Sponsorship opportunities for supporters
- **Community Support**: Clear call-to-action for donations, sponsorships, newsletter signup
- **Training Focus**: Prominent access to training data, progress tracking, expedition timeline

### Accessibility Standards
[Source: bmad-method/docs/architecture.md#coding-standards]
- **WCAG AA Compliance**: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, navigation landmarks, form labels
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile interactions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators with Swiss spa aesthetic

### Integration Points
- **Newsletter Signup**: Buttondown API integration in footer
- **Strava Integration**: Navigation should highlight training data access
- **AI Q&A System**: Navigation should include access to Ollama-powered assistant
- **Multi-Channel Funding**: Clear pathways to sponsorship and donation opportunities

### Performance Considerations
- **Critical CSS**: Inline navigation styles for faster loading
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for logos and navigation graphics
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load mobile navigation components when needed
- **Animation Performance**: Use transform and opacity for 60fps navigation transitions

### File Structure and Conventions
- **Header Component**: `/app/components/organisms/Header.tsx`
- **Footer Component**: `/app/components/organisms/Footer.tsx`
- **Layout Templates**: `/app/components/templates/DefaultLayout.tsx`
- **Mobile Navigation**: `/app/components/molecules/MobileNav.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: bmad-method/docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **E2E Navigation Tests**: Playwright tests for all navigation paths
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: Cross-device navigation functionality
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot tests for navigation consistency
- **Performance Tests**: Navigation loading times, animation smoothness

### Error Handling Requirements
- **Graceful Degradation**: Navigation works without JavaScript
- **Error Boundaries**: Premium styling for any navigation component failures  
- **404 Pages**: Swiss spa aesthetic for missing pages
- **Loading States**: Elegant spinners and skeleton screens during navigation

### Testing
**Test File Locations**: `/tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts` for comprehensive navigation testing  
**Testing Frameworks**: Playwright for E2E navigation, React Testing Library for component tests  
**Test Standards**: Keyboard navigation, mobile touch interactions, accessibility compliance, visual consistency
