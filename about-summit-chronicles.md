# About Summit Chronicles

Hi, I’m Sunith.

In 2013, I was bedridden — fighting tuberculosis, recovering from multiple surgeries, and barely able to walk 50 meters without collapsing. A year later, I stood on a Himalayan glacier during my first trek to Sar Pass, completely unprepared, out of breath, and slow. But I kept going.

That moment sparked something in me.

Since then, I've trekked through India’s most beautiful and brutal trails, summited Africa’s Kilimanjaro, South America’s Aconcagua, Europe’s Elbrus, and North America’s Denali — part of my ongoing journey to complete the Seven Summits.

But *Summit Chronicles* isn’t just about mountains.

It’s about what they do to us — physically, mentally, emotionally. It’s about the discipline, failure, fear, and transformation that happens in pursuit of something bigger than ourselves.

## Why This Exists

I created *Summit Chronicles* as a place to document my climbs, my training, and most importantly, the inner journey of rebuilding a life after disease, doubt, and defeat.

Whether you’re an aspiring adventurer, a concerned parent, or a fellow climber, I hope this space offers something for you — inspiration, information, and a reminder that the summit is never just the top of the mountain.

It's what happens to you on the way there.
