# My First Climb: The Spark I Didn’t See Coming

## Introduction Section

It was 2012. I had just wrapped up work at my first job in the corporate world, and all I wanted was a coffee break. That’s when Anirudh Ramesh, a friend and colleague, walked up and said, “Want to come on a trek to Coorg? It might be life-changing.” At the time, I didn’t realize how prophetic that line would be. That trip to Chikmagalur, tucked away in South India’s lush hills, became my first real taste of the outdoors—and unknowingly, the first step in my mountain journey.

## The Challenge Begins

I had no idea what I was getting into. I thought it would be a leisurely getaway, maybe some scenic views and resort-style comfort. What I got was raw, slippery terrain, cold winds, torrential rain, and narrow jeep rides up steep hills. I was underprepared in every sense—no proper gear, no research, no extra clothes, and certainly no idea of how tough walking through mushy trails all day could be.

The fatigue hit me fast. My gym workouts hadn’t prepared me for this kind of endurance. My “sports shoes” soaked through. My poncho barely held up. I was wet, freezing, and eventually, sick. That trip broke every illusion I had about being “fit.”

## Training and Preparation

To be honest, there wasn’t much preparation before this first climb—only the gym sessions I had been doing for aesthetics. I didn’t understand functional strength. I didn’t train for endurance or terrain. I didn’t even know what to pack.

But that trip planted a seed. It made me realize how important preparation would be if I ever wanted to experience that kind of adventure again—proper layers, hydration, conditioning, and research. I made every rookie mistake you could possibly make, but it also gave me the blueprint of what not to do.

## The Breakthrough Moment

Somewhere between slipping on muddy trails and standing in front of a thunderous waterfall that soaked me even from a distance, something shifted. The sheer power of nature, the feeling of being so small in such a big world—it overwhelmed me. But it also made me smile. There was a moment of clarity, standing at the base of that waterfall, when I knew I wanted more of this. Not the luxury. Not the comfort. But the raw, unfiltered, uncertain thrill of it all.

> "In the chaos of rain, wind, and exhaustion—I found a moment of peace. A strange kind of joy. And maybe that’s when I realized I wasn’t done with the outdoors. I had barely begun."

## Summit Success

There wasn’t a technical summit that day, no real mountain top. But in many ways, it was a summit for me. It was the peak of a new emotion: curiosity. I came back from that trek battered but lit up from within. I wanted to explore more trails, learn how to climb, and see more waterfalls.

I didn’t know it then, but this was the first breadcrumb on a path that would eventually lead me to Kilimanjaro, Elbrus, Denali, and Everest.

## Lessons Learned

Looking back, that first climb was a humbling teacher. I learned that strength without context means nothing in the wild. I learned that discomfort reveals character. But more than anything, I learned that you don’t need to be perfect to start—you just need to start.

That one unexpected trip with a friend, and a ₹300 poncho, became the origin story of my journey to the Seven Summits. I didn't climb a famous peak that day, but I climbed out of comfort—and that’s where it all truly began.
