Topic: [Training Day]

Key Points:

- Revised my training plan as I will need to wait another 3 weeks before I can start weight bearing with a protective boot on.

Below is the Plan:

DAILY ANKLE REHAB (EVERY DAY – NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Do this 2–3× per day, separate from workouts.

1️⃣ Ankle Pumps
	•	30 reps × 3 sets

2️⃣ Toe Curls
	•	20 reps × 3

3️⃣ Ankle Alphabets
	•	1 full alphabet × 2

4️⃣ Gentle ROM (Pain-Free Only)
	•	Dorsiflex / plantarflex
	•	15 reps each

👉 No force. No stretch pain. This is circulation + neural re-education.

Quotes/Thoughts:
- It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that I need to wait another 3 weeks to put my foot down and do some sort of walking. I guess I had my hopes high and wanted to get moving as soon as possible. Its a small setback, but thats what is normal in the mountains, I've learnt this in the mountains several times and now is the time to implement it here, and be patient.

Next Steps/Goals:
- Work on endurance for next 3 weeks.
