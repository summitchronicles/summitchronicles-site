As I sit here reflecting on my recent training session, I'm reminded that even the most experienced climbers can face setbacks. My latest injury has forced me to revise my training plan and wait another three weeks before I can start weight-bearing exercises with a protective boot on. It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that I need to slow down, but as someone who's spent countless hours in the mountains, I know that patience is key.

**Daily Ankle Rehab: The Non-Negotiable**

To ensure proper recovery and prevent further injury, I've committed to a daily ankle rehab routine. This involves a series of exercises designed to improve circulation, neural re-education, and gentle range of motion (ROM) work. Here's a breakdown of my daily routine:

### Daily Ankle Rehab

1. **Ankle Pumps**: 30 reps × 3 sets
2. **Toe Curls**: 20 reps × 3
3. **Ankle Alphabets**: 1 full alphabet × 2
4. **Gentle ROM (Pain-Free Only)**: Dorsiflex / plantarflex, 15 reps each

### Training Days

I've structured my training into four days, focusing on specific areas of strength and recovery.

#### DAY A — CORE + PARALLETTES (EVEREST CORE DAY)

1. **Parallette Support Hold**: Elbows locked, shoulders depressed, 5 × 20-30 sec
2. **Seated L-Sit Compression (Modified)**: Lift only the good leg, injured leg supported, 4 × 15-25 sec
3. **Dead Bug**: 4 × 10/side
4. **Side Plank (Knees)**: 3 × 30-45 sec / side
5. **Parallette Shoulder Shrugs**: Arms locked, 3 × 12

#### DAY B — PULL + GRIP (ZERO FALL RISK)

1. **Seated Band Rows**: 4 × 15-20
2. **Hangboard – FEET SUPPORTED**: Sit on chair/bench, hands on jug holds, feet fully supported, 6 × 10 sec holds
3. **Band Face Pulls**: 4 × 15
4. **Biceps Curl (Band or DB)**: 3 × 12-15
5. **Scap Pulls (Seated / Supported)**: 3 × 8-10

#### DAY C — PUSH + CHEST + PARALLETTES

1. **Parallette Push-Ups (Knees Down)**: Slow eccentric, 4 × 10-15
2. **Seated Band Chest Press**: 4 × 12-20
3. **Pike Lean on Parallettes (Isometric)**: Ice-axe loading simulation, 4 × 25-40 sec
4. **Seated Overhead Press (Band or DB)**: 3 × 12-15
5. **Triceps Pressdowns (Band)**: 3 × 15-20

#### DAY D — ACTIVE RECOVERY + ANKLE (THURSDAY)

* Only ankle rehab, gentle thoracic mobility, breathing drills, and no strength work

**Week-to-Week Progression**

I've outlined my training plan for the next three weeks:

1. **WEEK 1**: Learn positions, conservative holds, zero strain
2. **WEEK 2**: +5-10 sec on holds, +2 reps per set
3. **WEEK 3**: Slight forward lean, longer compression, still no failure

**Actual Training**

Here's what I've been doing:

1. **Dead Bug (Advanced)**: 4 × 8 / side
2. **Seated Pallof Press**: 4 × 10 / side (2-sec pause)
3. **Hollow Body Hold**: 4 × 20-40 sec
4. **Side Plank + Reach**: 3 × 25-40 sec / side
5. **Seated High-to-Low Band Chop**: 3 × 10 / side

**Next Steps/Goals**

As I continue to recover, my focus will shift towards building endurance for the next three weeks. It's a small setback, but one that will ultimately make me stronger and more resilient in the mountains.
