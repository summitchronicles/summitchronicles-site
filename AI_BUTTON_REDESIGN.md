## Design Decisions Rationale

### Why Rounded Square Instead of Circle?
- **Modern aesthetic** - Circles are becoming dated (iOS moved away from circles)
- **Better icon containment** - Square provides more visual weight
- **Consistent with modal** - Modal uses rounded rectangles
- **Professional feel** - More serious than playful circular buttons

### Why Gradient Instead of Solid?
- **Premium feel** - Gradients suggest quality and depth
- **Matches site design** - Site uses gradients throughout
- **Visual interest** - More engaging than flat colors
- **Brand consistency** - Glacier ‚Üí Alpine Blue matches brand

### Why Sparkle Icon?
- **Clear AI indicator** - Users know it's AI-powered
- **Premium association** - Sparkles suggest magic/intelligence
- **Trending design** - Modern AI interfaces use sparkles (ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Small but noticeable** - Doesn't overwhelm the main icon

### Why Tooltip After 2 Seconds?
- **Balance** - Not immediate (annoying), not too late (missed)
- **User-focused** - Appears when user is settling into the page
- **Dismissible** - Hover triggers it, interaction dismisses forever
- **Time-limited** - Auto-hides after 5s to avoid clutter

### Why Keyboard Shortcuts?
- **Power users** - ‚åòK is familiar from other tools (Notion, Linear)
- **Efficiency** - Faster than mouse for frequent users
- **Discoverability** - Badge and tooltip educate users
- **Accessibility** - Some users prefer keyboard navigation

## Brand Alignment

### Color Harmony
All colors from the existing Summit Chronicles palette:
- **Glacier blues** - Cool, professional, trustworthy
- **Alpine blues** - Adventure, mountaineering theme
- **Summit gold** - Achievement, premium, AI accent

### Visual Language Consistency

- **Typography** - Montserrat font family, consistent weights

### Mountaineering Theme
