# Summit Chronicles - Weekly Development Updates

## Week 1: Why I'm Building This

I've started building SummitChronicles.com.
The goal is to make it my personal portfolio, but also a place where I can test ideas with AI, APIs, and data.

Here's what I'm starting with:
- Next.js + Vercel for the frontend and hosting
- Strava API for pulling in my training data
- OpenAI API to experiment with content automation
- Database layer (still deciding between Supabase and Postgres) for storing logs and structured data

The bigger vision is not just a website.
I want it to evolve into a working example of how to bring together:
- Frontend + backend in a clean way
- Real APIs that people actually use
- AI features that are practical, not hype
- Data that can scale from small personal logs to something more complex

I'll share weekly updates here â€” what worked, what broke, and what I learned.

ðŸ‘‰ Next week: repo setup, first deployment, and the silly mistakes I made just trying to get the site live.

## Week 2: Setting Up Foundations

This week I moved from a blank page to connecting the first real pieces.

**Progress**
- Repo deployed on Vercel with a Next.js frontend.
- Connected the Strava API to start pulling in my activity data. The OAuth flow was painful â€” the access + refresh tokens took multiple retries before I got it right.
- Picked Supabase (Postgres) as the database. Easy setup, built-in auth, and it feels right for logging structured training data.
- Integrated the Cohere API instead of OpenAI. Main reason: Cohere offers a free tier, which makes it easier to test without worrying about costs. The plan is to use it for small things first â€” summarizing logs, drafting quick content, experimenting with text pipelines.

**Frustrations**
- The Strava callback kept failing because of a missing param. It took me way too long to realize the error was in my redirect URL.
- Database schema â€” I kept trying to design for the future (users, logs, sessions, analytics). In the end, I stripped it back to just the basics.
- Managing API keys between local and deployed versions was more annoying than I thought.

**Learnings**
- Don't chase the "perfect" schema in the beginning â€” working code matters more.
- OAuth always takes longer than planned.
- Choosing a free but good-enough LLM (Cohere) was the right call for now. I can always swap later if I need more capability.

## Week 3: Building Intelligence & Solving Real Problems

This week I shifted from basic setup to creating features that actually solve problems. The focus: turning my mountaineering experience into something useful for others.

**Major Progress**
- **Built a complete RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system** using Ollama locally + Supabase vector storage. Zero monthly costs, but GPT-3.5 level responses.
- **Fixed core UX issues** that were blocking real usage: like/share buttons on blogs, collaborative sponsorship approach (removed scary fixed pricing), and working AI responses.
- **Implemented credibility-first homepage design** â€” showing achievements and experience before asking for partnerships. Much better conversion psychology.
- **Corrected positioning** from narrow "Seven Summits mountaineer" to authentic "multi-discipline adventurer" covering mountains, ultra marathons, and exploration.

**Technical Deep Dive**
- **Free AI Stack**: Ollama (llama3.1:8b) + nomic-embed-text for local processing, Supabase free tier for vector storage, Next.js API routes for orchestration.
- **Smart Fallbacks**: System gracefully handles offline scenarios and provides rule-based responses when RAG unavailable.
- **Performance**: 2-5 second response times, completely free to operate, scales to handle thousands of questions.

**Frustrations**
- **Model downloads**: 5GB+ for the LLM took patience, but worth it for cost savings.
- **Git issues**: Special characters in file paths caused deployment hiccups (classic edge case).
- **Content creation bottleneck**: The AI infrastructure is ready, but I need to write actual expedition knowledge to train it properly.

**Learnings**
- **Start with user problems, not tech features** â€” the sponsorship pricing was scaring people away, AI giving generic responses was useless.
- **Local AI is production-ready** â€” don't need expensive cloud APIs for everything. Ollama + good hardware = powerful results.
- **ADHD-friendly development** â€” breaking complex features into clear checklists made everything manageable.

**Next Week Preview**
Adding my actual Seven Summits knowledge to the AI system, tackling image personalization (replacing generic stock photos), and potentially exploring partnership tracking features.

The site is becoming less "portfolio" and more "working product" â€” exactly what I wanted.
